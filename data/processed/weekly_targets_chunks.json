That can be largely attributed to the multi assignment and all of the imbalances attributed there, I\u2019ve done far too much work for it, and still have a lot more to do. Anyway, as long as it\u2019s completed well. Sat my first exam and fucking nailed it, so that\u2019s  a serious positive, as is submitting my first assignment to a good standard AND early, probably the first time ever. Outisde of study, I really have very little to show for this week, didn\u2019t go out, didn\u2019t visit Erica, did contact the fam, but prob could\u2019ve  had more craic this week. Next week I wanna get back up to the flow I had going and slightly lost, I need to make sure that assignment is submitted to a standard I\u2019m happy with",

This will be so important throughout my studies, it\u2019s the one skill I seriously need to make sure I master. It\u2019s not even the end of the week, and I have already let a few days be eaten up by spending excessive time on unimportant tasks. Seriously, I\u2019m not being fair to myself doing this, I need to be able to cut these things off. Blender\u2019s been put off for a good few weeks now, but it\u2019s a developing skill I will end up losing if I don\u2019t continue to invest time into it.

The lack of distractions was huge, as was the not wasting time in lectures, I was really able to dictate my own week, time to do the same again.

I don\u2019t really feel like doing this now, but seeing as this was this week\u2019s primary goal, and it\u2019s nearing the end of February, now\u2019s a better time than any. I feel like the theme of 2024 needs to be relationships- making new friends and staying in touch with old ones, growing my family relationships, and most importantly my relationship with myself. I really wanna open myself up as much as I can this year, I feel like i probably have a whole lot more to offer, but I\u2019m not simply from habit, from growing but not showing it. Obviously the main avenue I\u2019m currently pursuing is my Master\u2019s, and thank god I\u2019m loving it and learning so much, and it is so important to stay focused in it, but to be honest I do not believe it\u2019s near as important as having myself grow in more personal ways",
